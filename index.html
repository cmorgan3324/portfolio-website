      <!--About Me-->

        <h2>About Cory</h2>
        <p>
          I've worked in the healthcare industry in various office management roles since graduating from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 2016. After a few years, I realized
          the system structure didn't appeal to me and I yearned for something
          that can allow me to not only develop hard skills but also utilize
          them for others and myself to benefit from.
          <br />
          <br />
          Full-stack development and software engineering enable me to
          contribute to the technological advancement of the world, in any and
          all industries, and to collaborate with other developers to bring
          their visions to life.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm passionate about learning more with and from others to deepen my
          understanding of software engineering. When I'm not coding, I enjoy going out to
          eat, playing basketball, and weightlifting.
